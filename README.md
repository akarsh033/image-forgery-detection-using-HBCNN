# Image-Forgery-Detection-using-HBCNN
 
 The amount of photographic data created over the past ten years has significantly increased with the introduction of social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram. These pictures are the main components of false news, and they are frequently employed for evil purposes like inciting mobs. We must confirm the legitimacy of a photograph before taking any action based on it.

This repository will be about a deep learning approach to solve the challenge to identify if an image is forged or not. Everything from data cleaning, pre-processing, CNN architecture to training and evaluation is carried out on dataset from First Image Forensics Challenge.
